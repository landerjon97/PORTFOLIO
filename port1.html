            Hello, My name is Jonathan Lander, I am studying Computer cience at Clarion University of Pennsylvania. 
            I hope to work with mobile devices such as smart phones. I found computers very interesting ever since elementary school 
            and with the popularity of smart phones I feel like mobile developement would be a great place to start.
