                <p> On my free time I like like to do many things..
                    <ol>
                        <li> I like to take apart and build computer systems with friends. </li>
                        <li> I try to stay healthy by going to gym every day of the week. I believe staying healthy is a nessesary
                            for staying awake during the day and boosting ones own mood. </li>
                        <li> Most recently I have been very into photography. I don't normally find a reason to be outside other than to 
                            exercise and work. I bought a camera to enjoy nature and be able express my feelings through pictures. </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p> I'm a workaholic. I love to work. I cant never just sit around relax. Thats why currently have two jobs:
                    <ol>
                        <li> Trails End Resaurant in Cook Forest. </li>
                        <li> Clarion University ITV technician. </li>
                    </ol>
                    I just enjoy being out and doing something productive and not sitting at home.

                <p>
                    I enjoy meeting new people and I am very out going and laid back. I try my hardest when it comes to working because I
                    really enjoy looking at my work when it's done so I can go further to critique it. I enjoy solving problems and working with
                    others to solve those problems. I also believe that I am a good leader because of how laid back I am, Sure there's times to have
                    fun but sometimes there are times that work is needed in order to progess any farther. Getting along with other is also very important
                    for leading and I believe I can become friends with almost anyone. I am never afraid of a challenge, If there's a will there's a way.
